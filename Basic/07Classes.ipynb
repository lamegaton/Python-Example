    "## Python Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it's designed to model real-world entities using classes and objects. Here's an overview of key concepts related to classes and OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific instance or occurrence of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: \"Alice\"\n",
    "print(person2.age)   # Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance and Class Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variable:** A variable that belongs to a specific instance/object. Each object can have different values for instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Variable:** A variable that belongs to the class and is shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class and are used to perform actions related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor (`__init__`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method (constructor) that gets called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass/base class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, age)  # Call the parent class constructor\n",
    "        self.student_id = student_id\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, I'm a student with ID {self.student_id}. {super().greet()}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class, through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "people = [person1, student1]  # Both Person and Student objects\n",
    "for person in people:\n",
    "    print(person.greet())  # Calls the appropriate greet method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there's no strict private access modifier, but you can indicate that an attribute should be treated as private by prefixing it with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
    "        self._title = title    # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.author = author   # Public attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance. They don't have access to instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathUtility:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def square(x):\n",
    "        return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = MathUtility.square(5)  # Use the static method without creating an object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are foundational to understanding object-oriented programming in Python. Classes and objects allow you to model complex real-world systems in a structured and organized manner."

    "## Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In the example below, we'll define a `Shape` base class and two subclasses (`Circle` and `Square`) that implement the `area` method differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "class Square(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side):\n",
    "        self.side = side\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "shapes = [Circle(3), Square(4)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(f\"Area of the shape: {shape.area()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `Circle` and `Square` classes implement the `area` method differently, but they're treated as `Shape` instances when looping through the list of shapes. This demonstrates polymorphism, as the same interface (`area`) is used to access different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are defined within a class but don't have access to instance-specific data. They're often used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't depend on instance attributes. Here's an example using a static method for formatting strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class StringUtils:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def capitalize_words(sentence):\n",
    "        words = sentence.split()\n",
    "        capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words]\n",
    "        return \" \".join(capitalized_words)\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = \"hello world\"\n",
    "capitalized_sentence = StringUtils.capitalize_words(sentence)\n",
    "print(capitalized_sentence)  # Output: \"Hello World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `capitalize_words` static method doesn't depend on any instance attributes. You can call it using the class name without creating an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are useful when you need a method associated with a class but don't need to interact with instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples showcase how polymorphism allows different classes to share a common interface and how static methods provide utility functions related to a class without requiring instance data."
