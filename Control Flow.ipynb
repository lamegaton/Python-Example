    "## Control Flow Statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow statements are used to control the order in which statements are executed in a Python program. They allow you to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used for conditional execution. It checks a condition, and if it's true, the indented block of code under the `if` statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If-Else Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if-else` statement allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is even\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is odd\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If-Elif-Else Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if-elif-else` statement is used to handle multiple conditions sequentially. It allows you to check multiple conditions and execute the corresponding block of code for the first true condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"B\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"C\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"F\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely based on a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 2:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Range Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers that can be used in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pass Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement is a placeholder statement that does nothing. It's often used when you need syntactically correct code but don't want to execute any code at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 10:\n",
    "    pass  # To be implemented later\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These control flow statements are fundamental to programming in Python. They allow you to make decisions, loop through sequences, and control the flow of your program's execution."
