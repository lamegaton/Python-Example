    "## Comprehensions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions are concise and expressive ways to create new lists, dictionaries, sets, and iterators by applying an operation to each element of an existing sequence or iterable. They provide a more readable and efficient alternative to traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions allow you to create new lists by applying an expression to each element of an existing iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary comprehensions allow you to create new dictionaries by specifying key-value pairs generated from an existing iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n",
    "name_lengths = {name: len(name) for name in names}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Set comprehensions allow you to create new sets by applying an expression to each element of an existing iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "unique_squares = {x ** 2 for x in numbers}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Tools - `map` and `filter`:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to comprehensions, Python also provides functional tools like `map` and `filter` that can be used to create more expressive and concise comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `map` Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` function applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `filter` Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` function filters elements from an iterable based on a given function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: List Comprehension with `map` and `filter`:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine list comprehensions with the `map` and `filter` functions for more complex operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_evens = [x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a list comprehension is used to calculate the squares of even numbers from the `numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comprehensions and functional tools provide a concise and readable way to create new sequences or apply transformations to existing ones. They can significantly enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of your code."

    "## What is SET?\n",
    "A set is a built-in data type in Python that represents an unordered collection of unique elements. It's not a new list, dictionary, or tuple, but a distinct data structure with its own characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key properties of sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unordered:** Sets do not maintain any specific order of elements, unlike lists and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique Elements:** Sets only store unique elements. If you try to add the same element multiple times, it will be stored only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutable:** Sets are mutable, which means you can add and remove elements after the set is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Duplicates:** Since sets store unique elements, duplicates are automatically removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Indexing:** Sets do not support indexing, slicing, or any other form of positional access to elements. This is because they are unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Keys:** Unlike dictionaries, sets do not have key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or by using the `set()` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}  # Creating a set using curly braces\n",
    "another_set = set([4, 5, 6])  # Creating a set using set() constructor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding and Removing Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method and remove elements using the `remove()` or `discard()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set.add(4)      # Adding an element\n",
    "my_set.remove(2)   # Removing an element\n",
    "my_set.discard(3)  # Removing an element without raising an error if not present\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets support various mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "union = set1 | set2              # Union of sets\n",
    "intersection = set1 & set2       # Intersection of sets\n",
    "difference = set1 - set2         # Difference of sets (elements in set1 but not in set2)\n",
    "symmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2  # Symmetric difference (elements in either set1 or set2 but not in both)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are particularly useful when you need to maintain a collection of unique elements and perform operations that involve set theory concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that due to their unordered nature, sets are not suitable when you need to maintain the order of elements or associate values with keys, for which lists and dictionaries are more appropriate."
