    "## Exception Handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a critical aspect of writing robust and error-tolerant programs. In Python, exceptions are raised when errors or exceptional situations occur during the execution of code. Exception handling allows you to catch and handle these exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try-Except Block:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception. The `except` block is used to catch and handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Except Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    value = int(\"abc\")  # ValueError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid value\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Else Clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause is executed if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally Clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` clause is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's commonly used for cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Do something with the file\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: File not found\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()  # Close the file, even if an exception occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create custom exceptions by defining new classes that inherit from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    if something_bad_happened:\n",
    "        raise MyCustomError(\"Something bad happened\")\n",
    "except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Custom Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Multiple Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use parentheses to catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero or invalid value\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raising Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can raise exceptions using the `raise` statement. This is useful when you want to indicate that an exceptional situation has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    if y == 0:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Division by zero\")\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling helps ensure that your program continues running smoothly even in the presence of errors. It also enables you to provide meaningful error messages to users and handle cleanup operations effectively."
