    "Absolutely, I can help you understand the usage of regular expressions in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular Expressions (Regex):\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow you to search for, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Functions for Regex:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides the `re` module for working with regular expressions. Here are some basic functions for using regular expressions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `re.match(pattern, string)`: Checks if the pattern matches at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `re.search(pattern, string)`: Searches for the pattern anywhere in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Returns all occurrences of the pattern in the string as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `re.finditer(pattern, string)`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`: Replaces occurrences of the pattern with the replacement string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns and Metacharacters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.\n",
    "- `^`: Matches the start of a string.\n",
    "- `$`: Matches the end of a string.\n",
    "- `\\d`: Matches any digit (0-9).\n",
    "- `\\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character.\n",
    "- `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character.\n",
    "- `[abc]`: Matches either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n",
    "- `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences.\n",
    "- `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences.\n",
    "- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.\n",
    "- `{m}`: Matches exactly `m` occurrences.\n",
    "- `{m, n}`: Matches between `m` and `n` occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have the following text and want to extract email addresses from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Contact us at john@example.com or jane@example.net\"\n",
    "pattern = r'\\b\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+\\b'  # Basic email pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "emails = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "print(emails)  # Output: ['john@example.com', 'jane@example.net']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the regular expression `r'\\b\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+\\b'` is used to match email addresses. Here's what the pattern means:\n",
    "- `\\b`: Matches a word boundary.\n",
    "- `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).\n",
    "- `@`: Matches the \"@\" character.\n",
    "- `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (the domain name).\n",
    "- `\\.`: Matches a dot.\n",
    "- `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (the top-level domain).\n",
    "- `\\b`: Matches another word boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex patterns can also take flags to modify their behavior. Common flags include `re.IGNORECASE` (for case-insensitive matching) and `re.MULTILINE` (for multiline matching).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pattern = r'pattern'\n",
    "result = re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raw Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended to use raw strings (`r'pattern'`) for regex patterns to avoid unintended escaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a powerful tool for text manipulation and searching. While this overview provides a basic introduction, regex can get quite complex and powerful as you become more familiar with it."
