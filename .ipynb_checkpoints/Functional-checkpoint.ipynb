    "## Functional Programming in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Python supports functional programming to some extent, and you can use functional programming patterns to write more readable, modular, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key concepts of functional programming in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming promotes using immutable data, meaning data that cannot be changed after it's created. In Python, tuples and namedtuples are examples of immutable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of using tuples\n",
    "point = (3, 4)  # An immutable point (x, y)\n",
    "new_point = point + (1, 2)  # Creates a new point by adding a tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They don't modify external state or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 5)  # Calling the pure function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-Order Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def apply_function(func, x):\n",
    "    return func(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "def double(x):\n",
    "    return x * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = apply_function(double, 5)  # Calling a higher-order function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map, Filter, and Reduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` that are commonly used in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))  # Applying a function to each element\n",
    "even = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # Filtering elements\n",
    "total = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  # Reducing elements to a single value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions allow you to create new lists by applying an expression to each element of an existing iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # Creating a new list using a comprehension\n",
    "even = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # Filtering elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has libraries like `functools` and `itertools` that provide tools for functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import functools\n",
    "\n",
    "result = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # Using functools.reduce\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python is not a purely functional programming language, these functional programming concepts can help you write cleaner, more modular, and more predictable code."

    "## Example of using the `filter` function in Python to filter out even numbers from a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using filter to get even numbers\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `filter` function takes two arguments: a lambda function that specifies the filtering condition (in this case, `x % 2 == 0` to check if a number is even), and the iterable (`numbers`). The `filter` function returns an iterator containing only the elements that satisfy the condition. To get the filtered numbers as a list, we use the `list` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a new list `even_numbers` that contains only the even numbers from the original `numbers` list."
